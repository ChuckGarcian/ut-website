Order, methodical and systematic. These were the threads that seamed together Eric Bonderbon. A man of precision, he lived his life like a finely tuned clock. Every second was accounted for, and no second was wasted. His world was the epitome of routine and synchronicity, a song driven by the rise and fall of the sun. Every morning at exactly 7 am, he would wake up, without an alarm, got dressed, and was ready for work, arriving at work at 7:30. He worked for exactly 8 hours, before arriving home at 4:00. He worked out for exactly one hour, showered by 5:30, and was asleep by 11. He was not particularly ugly, but also not particularly handsome. His body was well-kept, and his face was well-groomed. Without a doubt, Eric Bonderbon was not your average middle-aged man.

Eric Bonderbon worked tirelessly on the projects at work, obsessive even. Nothing mattered more to him beyond schedules, marks, and most importantly, time efficiency. 

One evening at home, Eric thought he perceived something in his peripheral vision, but when he turned, nothing was there. He continued working. A few moments later, he looked again and what stood there was a tall, humanoid-looking figure facing directly towards him. Its skin was an absorbing black color-- so black that its body had no 3D shape to it. It was as if one was peering into a black hole that was shaped as a tall, slender man. Its head was an almost cartoonishly large oval shape. Eric froze for several moments before realizing what he was looking at was a pile of black running clothes on the table.

A few days later at work early in the morning before anyone else was present, Eric sat upright and well-postured at his desk, typing away, when he noticed the black figure again at the corner of his view. This time, Eric quickly swiveled his head towards it, again seeing the light-absorbing figure he had seen three days prior. Similar to the last time, the figure was simply an illusion brought on by a pile of binders on his coworker's desk. Eric was unfazed and snapped back to work.

After the third time this occurred, Eric decided to visit a doctor who told him it was a 'psychosis singularity' driven by work-related stress, and that he should not bother. But after the fourth time, Eric decided to name the 'mental singularity' 'the abacus man' after the ancient counting device, since its head reminded Eric of the beads on the abacus he had at home.

Thereafter the almost daily appearances of 'the abacus man' totally unphased Eric. If Eric drove to work, he would see it in the parking lot. Working out, it was by the weights. Sleeping, it was at the foot of his bed. At this point he was used to the almost daily occurrences. The abacus man was a silent observer in Eric's life.

Halfway through another workday, the Abacus Man was standing there as it had done so many times before, but this time something stood out to Eric. The first couple of times he saw the 'Abacus Man', it was standing well over 20 feet away, but now it was standing about 7 feet away -- it was slowly getting closer to him. Eric sat there for several moments, systematically analyzing what this meant. 

[Internal monologue to be added]

Then one day, as Eric sat at his desk typing away, he saw the abacus man again. But this time, the abacus man was standing directly in front of him. Eric looked up at its oval shaped head, but this time the apparition did not disappear. Instead it took a step forward, absorbing Eric in the process....
