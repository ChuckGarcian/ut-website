Eric Bonderbon was a methodical and programmatic middle-aged man. Every morning at exactly 7 am, Eric woke up, without an alarm, got dressed and ready for work, and arrived at work at 7:30. He worked for exactly 8 hours, before arriving home at 4:00. He worked out for exactly one hour. His bofy well kept, face well groomed, Eric Bonderbon without a doubt was not your average middle-aged man. He was not particularly ugly, but also not particularly hansom.

  Eric Bonderbon worked tirelessly on the projects at work, obsessive even. Nothing mattered more to him beyond schedules, marks, and most importantly, time efficiency. Every second of his day was counted, and no second wasted.

  ------------------

  ## An interview with myself
  To help think through this short story.

  Q: What is the driving conflict?
  A: Eric is your average 'joe' -- for the most part he is no different then you or me. So when he is faced with the 'abacus man' evidently it poses some obstacle to the status qou.

  Q: Is the 'abacus man' a metaphor? Why or why not.
  I would like to think that the abacus man is a metaphor that represents something deeper about Eric. But more generally, I think it's representative of the sins one can take on in life.

  - Why not keep it simple? Make the 'abacus man' be a metaphor for death.
  - abstractly this would make the story generic. It's a basic metaphore for death and how it creeps up on us. but its more nuanced here in the case of eric given the his workaholic nature.

  The big 'WHY':
  In essence, the characters of Eric and the 'Abacus Man' serve as a metaphor for the perils of adopting an attitude that trivializes the importance of life, while simultaneously exhibiting a mindless disregard for the concept of death.
  I say mindless, since Eric just lets this happen as his priority is work and he doesn't think about the shortness of it all. 

  ------------------

  ## First Occurrence:
  Location: Home

  Eric thought he perceived something in his peripheral vision, but when he turned, nothing was there. He continued working.

  He looked again and what stood there was a tall, humanoid-looking figure facing directly towards him. Its skin was an absorbing black color-- so black that its body had no 3D shape to it. It was as if one was peering into a black hole that was shaped as a tall, slender man. Its head was an almost cartoonishly large oval shape.

  Eric froze for several moments before realizing what he was looking at was a pile of black running shorts clothes on the table. 

  ## Second Occurrence:
  Location: Workplace

  It was early morning at work before anyone else was present. Eric sat upright and well-postured at his desk, typing away, when he noticed a black figure at the corner of his view. This time, Eric quickly swiveled his head towards it, again it was the light-absorbing figure he had seen three days prior. Similar to the last time, the figure was simply an illusion brought on by a pile of binders on his coworker's desk. Eric was unfazed and snapped back to work.

  After the third time this occurred, Eric decided to visit a doctor who told him it was a 'psychosis singularity' driven by work-related stress, and that he should not bother.

  After the fourth time, Eric decided to name the 'mental singularity' so aptly named 'abacus man' after the ancient counting device since its head reminded Eric of the beads on the abacus he had at home.


  ## Moreafter:

  Thereafter the almost dailly appearences of appearances of the 'abacus man' totally unphased Eric.

  If Eric drove to work, he would see it in the parking lot.
  Working out, by the weights
  Sleeping at the foot of his bed. 

  Note: All of these times Erid is unphased by 'the abacus man'--at this point he is used to the almost daily occurence.

  The abacus man was a silent observer in Eric's life.

  ## Penultimate 

  ##j

  Location: Workplace Halfway

  Halfway through his workday, the Abacus Man was standing there as it had done so many times before, but this time something stood out to Eric. The first couple of times he saw the 'Abacus Man', it was standing well over 20 feet away, but now it was standing about 7 feet away -- it was slowly getting closer to him. Eric sat there for several moments, systematically analyzing what this meant. 

  [Add an internal monologue by Eric that when juxtaposed with the final paragraph, give a bigger 'upmh'. ] 

  ## Finality
  Eric sat at his desk typing away when he saw the abacus man. 
  The abacus man was standing directly infront of him. Eric looked up at his ovel shaped head, but this time abirition did not disapear. Instead it took a step forward absorbing eric in the process....[done and done. this it]
