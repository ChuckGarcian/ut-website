Here are some quotes I have collected over the years:   
  
> "Beyond a moderate level of material comfort, happiness consists of two things: feeling connected to others and engaging in meaningful work." \
> \
> ― William Deresiewicz

> “No man has the right to be an amateur in the matter of physical training. It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.” \
> \
> ― Socrates

> "All models are wrong, but some are useful”. \
> \
> ― George E. P. Box

> "The formulation of NP-completeness, and the
proof that all these problems are equivalent, is a powerful thing: it says that
all these open questions are really a single open question, a single type of
complexity that we don’t yet fully understand." \
> \
> ― Introduction To Algorithms: NP-Completeness
