Trumpet-like sounds hummed and boomed, vibrating through the air and into John's body, jolting him awake. His eyes fluttered open in a panic, gasping for air, only to be met with a blinding white light. As he lay there, the cacophony and brightness gradually faded, leaving silence and dimness in their wake.

Rising from the floor, the chill of the air bit at his skin, sending shivers down his spine. Confused and disoriented, John looked concernedly down at his body. He was wearing blue, long-cut jeans, bright white shoes, and a black shirt. He went to check his pockets but was greeted with a sharp pain in his right pointer finger. Glancing down at his hands, he noticed his finger was burned. The burn itself was not the odd thing, but rather the shape of it. On the tip of John's right index finger was a horizontal burn. It seemed 'fresh' as it was red and not yet blistered. 

He continued to assess his situation. He looked around noticed shelves of food: shelves with containers of frozen red meat, cut tomatoes, onions, and olives. He saw shelves with whole chickens and sauces. It became apparent to him that he was in some sort of freezer.
