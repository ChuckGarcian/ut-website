Trumpet-like sounds hummed and boomed, vibrating through the air and into John’s body, jolting him awake. His eyes fluttered open in a panic, gasping for air, only to be met with a blinding white light. The cacophony and brightness gradually faded as he lay there, leaving silence and dimness in their wake.

Like how one might be after abruptly waking from a deep sleep, John’s mind was seeping with confusion and grogginess while his body writhed back and forth. Instinctively, he brought his hand to his face and temples, trying to center himself, and as he did, the mental fog gradually gave way to hyperawareness.

The sharp, cold hands of anxiety gripped his chest as his thoughts raced from one end of his mind to the other – they were disjointed and schizophrenically charged: ’What am I.., what is.., where is..”.

The primal urge to survive took hold, and John turned over onto his belly into the prone position and simultaneously outstretched his arm to push himself up. As he rose from the floor, the chill of the air bit at his skin, sending shivers down his spine. He looked concernedly down at his body. He was wearing blue, long-cut jeans, bright white shoes, and a black shirt. He went to check his pockets but was greeted with a sharp pain in his hand. Quickly glancing down at his hands, John noticed a small horizontal-shaped wound on the tip of his finger. It seemed ‘fresh’ as it was red and tender and not yet blistered.

He continued to assess his situation. He looked around noticed shelves of food: shelves with containers of frozen red meat, cut tomatoes, onions, and olives. He saw shelves with whole chickens and sauces. It became apparent to him that he was in some sort of freezer.
