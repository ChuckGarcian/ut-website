# Chapters Outline
1. Trumpets of Mercy
   - We meet our main character.
   - John is set on the quest to solve his 'Jason Bourne' esque mystery.
   - Along the way, we meet a girl who is a foil to John.
     - As a story device, she acts as the force that drives the story forward.
      
2. Phenomenality
   - John discovers he is in a simulation.
   - Through some means, he is given the option to turn off the simulation.
     - Unplugging the simulation means John and everyone in that universe will cease to exist.
   - Our hero is faced with a dilemma to either end the sim or not.

3. Ego
   - John decides to turn off the simulation. 
     - Unexpectedly, 'shutting down the simulation' doesn't really end it, instead, it triggers a reset for John, taking him back to the start of the narrative.
   - We are lead to believe this occurs indefinitely 

# Questions to Consider
- What happens in between C1 and C2?
  - I.E. How does John get from not knowing he's in a sim to knowing he is in a sim.

- What drives John turn off the simulation?
  - Driven by insanity? 


## Why John?
Why is John the one who is experiencing this? Is John the 'center' of this universe? I would like to think that he is not.

Well first of I suppose theres the idea that the individual(s) responsible for this simulation could be trying to run some sort of experiment.
